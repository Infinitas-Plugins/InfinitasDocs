### Creating docs

Documents are created using [markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), a light weight markup language. The docs are generated by some simple controller code that will find any file with the `.md` extension. These docs are automatically categorised by plugin and do not need to be compiled to view. The can even be read quite easily without even being converted to HTML.

### Doc categories

There are three categories a doc can be in:

- Developer: These are docs aimed at developers looking to build custom plugins and extend Infinitas
- Designer: These docs are aimed at designers trying to customise the look and feel of an Infinitas powered website 
- Users: These docs are aimed at administrators that run an Infinitas powered website on a day to day basis

Pages will automatically have links to various things such as a switch for the documentation type Eg: `[/infinitas\_docs/switch/developer](/infinitas\_docs/switch/developer)` and links for navigating the various plugins. Errors are also handled for missing pages such as `[Missing Plugin](/infinitas\_docs/MissingPlugin)` or `[Missing Page](/infinitas\_docs/InfinitasDocs/missing_page)`

### Markdown

All that is required is to create markdown files with a `.md` extension anywhere in a plugin. It is recomended to use `/YourPlugin/Doc/*` as the location for documentation so that it is easy to find if not viewing though the site.

The markdown parser being used to render the pages can be found [here](https://github.com/garygolden/markdown-oo-php). The Infinitas version is part of the [Developer](https://github.com/Infinitas-Plugins/developer) plugin and has been forked from `garygolden's` repo.

### Security

If debug is enabled the documentation can be viewed using a web browser by navigating to `/infinitas\_docs` on an Infinitas powered web site. If you would like to be able to view the documentation while debug is disabled there is an option in the configs `InfinitasDocs.allow_live` which when set to true will allow the docs to be viewed always.

Markdown files are searched for using SPL classes for Iteration and checks to make sure the plugin is valid and the file has an extension of `.md`. 

### Tips

When writing documentation it is easy to reference a link to somewhere in the application such as `[/admin](/admin)`. This is especially handy for building user guides. You can also use links such as `[/infinitas\_docs/InfinitasDocs/roadmap](/infinitas\_docs/InfinitasDocs/roadmap)` as the routing is hard coded and should not change.
