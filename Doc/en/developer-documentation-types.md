You are able to create various types of documentation with relative ease. The available types include

- developers
- designers
- end users

> This has not yet been completely implemented yet, currently all documentation is displayed in one list.

### Developers

To create documentation for developers, simply prepend the file name with `developer`. 

### Designers

Similar to the developer documentation, to create for designers prepend the file with `designer`. 

### End user

To create documentation aimed at the end user there is no need for any special prefix. If neither of the above are found in the file name it would be assumed that the documentation is for the end user.
