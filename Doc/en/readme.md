The InfinitasDocs plugin provides a simple way for developers to create documentation that is easily accessed by users of the application. It also makes it simple to create docs that are targeted at either other developers, designers or the end user.

All the documentation requires is to be created using markdown and saved within the plugin with the `.md` extension. See below for more detailed information and usage examples.
