This is plain text.

This is <em>empasis</em> word.
Another <em>empasis</em> word.
<em>Whole sentense is emphasis</em>
<em>Even
multiline works!</em>

I can also do <strong>bolded</strong> words.
<strong>Really</strong>, markdown is amazing!

All this can be done with * and _ characters, yes * and _

Just surround word like this \*word\* or \_word\_ for <em>.
Or \*\*word\*\* or \_\_word\_\_ for <strong>
